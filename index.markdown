Introduction
================================================================================

PSAS has flown 3 major rocket desgns: LV0, LV1, LV2[^1]. LV stands for Launch Vehicle, just a fancy name for "rocket". Each vehicle is numbered in order that we built it. The major number are the class of rocket. For instance every LV2 rocket is of the same design (with minor adjustments or additions). Each minor division is a build of that design.

In total PSAS has built 5 rockets. Most have flown many flights over the years. LV2.3 was our work-horse rocket for 7 years.

Motivation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the LV2 design[^2] has been very successful, going forward it has two detractions:

 1. The diameter is too small to fit a CubeSat
 2. The frame design is two piece (complicated) and relatively heavy

Carbon Fiber
================================================================================

In 2014 PSAS sponsored a capstone[^3] to investigate and design a single tube made of carbon fiber to be as light and strong as possible. Instead of asking for a finished product, we asked for a set of tools and design spec in order to make as many sections as we need in the future.
