Carbon Fiber
================================================================================

In 2014 PSAS sponsored a capstone[^2014capstone] to investigate and design a single tube made of carbon fiber to be as light and strong as possible. Instead of asking for a finished product, we asked for a set of tools and design spec in order to make as many sections as we need in the future.
